This open source initiative is a response to the challenges that enterprises face in terms of adopting and integrating AI into their applications at scale. By laying the groundwork for scalable AI platforms, Tetrate and Bloomberg engineers are addressing the immediate needs of today’s enterprises and setting the stage for the future of AI applications within cloud-native environments.

Envoy AI Gateway builds on the capabilities of the CNCF’s Envoy Gateway project, one of the Kubernetes Gateway API implementations Link embedded into text. It taps Envoy’s robust, scalable foundation and enables organizations to integrate modern GenAI functionality into their workflows and applications. The Envoy AI Gateway routes requests to multiple AI service providers and models through a single reverse proxy layer and provides a single, unified API layer with which developers interact.

## First Headline (Quote Example)

Envoy AI Gateway is being used by Bloomberg to build generative AI applications that interact with GenAI services – whether on-prem or in the cloud – at scale. The Gateway gives Bloomberg a central place to manage the usage of GenAI services through a consistent, unified API – regardless of provider – by setting limits and quotas, and consistently enforcing access control to GenAI services across the company’s AI infrastructure. This approach simplifies generative AI application development, and will help the company’s engineers create innovative AI services faster for Bloomberg users.

## Bullet List Example

Community organizers have already identified several new features that are now on the project roadmap, including:

- Google Gemini 2.0 Integration out-of-the-box
- Provider and Model Fallback Logic to ensure continuation of services should an AI service become temporarily unavailable
- Prompt Templating to provide consistent context to the LLM service across requests
- Semantic Caching to lower LLM usage costs by reusing responses from semantically similar requests, thereby minimizing expensive LLM interactions
